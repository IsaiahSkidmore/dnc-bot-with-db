# Request for Removal of Copied Code from NeighborhoodAid â€“ DMCA Notice Filed  

Hi Isaiah,  

I have identified that this repository, **`dnc-bot-with-db`**, contains multiple files copied from my original project, **NeighborhoodAid**, without proper attribution or permission. As NeighborhoodAid is licensed under the **MIT License**, any reuse of the code requires retaining the original license and providing appropriate credit.  

To resolve this matter, I have already **submitted a DMCA Takedown Notice** with GitHub. As part of this process, I am reaching out directly through this issue to **request that you either:**  

1. **Remove all copied content** from this repository, or  
2. **Fork the NeighborhoodAid repository**, apply the necessary modifications, and retain the **MIT License** with proper credit to the original project.

## Issue Summary  

To confirm the plagiarism, I used **Meld** (a visual diff tool) and **Git Blame** to compare the code between both repositories. These tools confirmed that multiple files were copied with **little to no modification**, including middleware, controllers, and configuration files.  

However, using copied content without proper attribution constitutes **plagiarism** and violates both **academic integrity** and **open-source principles**. The copied files contain **references to "NeighborhoodAid"** and reflect work beyond the course scope, which I personally developed and **pushed to the repository**.  

I have already **informed our professor and academic advisor** to ensure transparency and accountability. While the solo project was meant to demonstrate your understanding, copying content without attribution does not align with those expectations or academic standards.  

Given our prior interactions, I felt it was necessary to file a **DMCA Takedown Notice** to ensure this issue is handled appropriately. However, I am still hopeful that we can resolve this matter directly and professionally, without further intervention from GitHub.

## Next Steps  

To resolve this matter, I respectfully request that you:  

1. **Remove all copied content** from the `dnc-bot-with-db` repository, or  
2. **Fork the NeighborhoodAid repository**, apply the necessary modifications, and retain the **MIT License** with appropriate credit.  

If the issue is not resolved, GitHub will proceed with the **DMCA Takedown Notice**, which may result in the removal of this repository.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. Please let me know if you have any questions or need assistance.  

Sincerely,
